                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be wary of timings there were a few times you overlooked angles because you thought it was extremely unlikely that an enemy would be in that position and it got you punished.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes peeking an angle unfocused delays your reaction time and makes your peek a bit sloppy.</li>
                    <li>Falling alseep on angles without using techniques to regain focus, like jiggle peeking or moving your crosshair.</li>
                    <li>Certain angles are not worth jiggle peeking as it just gives away your intentions and allows the enemy on that angle to refocus and be ready for your repeek.</li>
                    <li>Bad pathing up vents into an A retake is not advisable as you are completely inaccurate while on the ladder and for a while after you get out the vents almost guaranteeing a disadvantageous fight.</li>
                    <li>Throwing LOS(Line of sight) utility is incredibly dangerous and usually not worth the risk.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>FFA Community-Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>USP deathmatch, solid movement and peeking around the map.</li>
                    <li>Good job taking your time to line up shots with the usp and not just spamming.</li>
                    <li>Quick switching quite often our of habit even though the movement speed with the usp is very close to that of the knife.</li>
                    <li>Solid spray control in close and medium-range engagements.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Nuke</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, no comms, nice positioning garage to hold outside keeping that distance, rotating through secret, unfortunately, the enemy had already gotten into an advanced position door angle which catches you completely off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle smoke, good use of a headshot angle to try get the advantage on the enemies top silo,  getting a little tagged, nice positioning second vent unfortunately the enemies were holding that position so when you peeked out they got you instantly. L</li>
                    <li>Scout, no armour interesting buy, solid positioning behind blue container holding the outside swing, unfortunately, your positioning wasn’t ideal when you went for the top mini peek, and again going for the 2v4 retake wasn’t a good idea wherever the number of the enemies is double your you should immediately save, unfortunately when you did decide to save the enemy top secret was already ready for you on the railing off-angle. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid utility outside, and good positioning unfortunately you were holding the angle unfocused this allowed the enemy to react to your position and get quite a lucky headshot on you as he was not ready for you. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle utility, small utility mistake missing the smoke, the jiggle into door allowed the enemy to be weary of your position and allowed the enemy to be ready to prefire you in this fight, I would always recommend if they blow the door preaim and be ready to shoot on that first peek. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good economy saving by not buying head armour, this is effective because the enemies have AK’s and AWPs, unfortunately, your teammate decided it would be a better idea to kill you. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, nice use of the Glave smoke in order to get the kill on the enemy silo, generally with the famas you want to try position yourself in a way that you are extremely close to the enemy as the famas is by far the worst rifle available it should be treated more as an upgraded SMG and only really used in close range engagements. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, good job picking up an upgraded weapon from the previous round, missed molly landing in Mini, solid rotation through to B after they planted, no enemies engaged no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, Molly landed properly, this round, your rotation was off as you went secret towards B but the bomb was planted on A and you were not able to help your teammate retake the site, also took a disadvantageous route into the retake which is not ideal. L</li>\
                    <li>AWP buy, after spotting no-one outside, you rotated to heaven landed some solid utility, really nice kill on the retake, and smoking your teammate to ninja. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, solid peek outside allows you to get an early pick, interesting reposition to CT to hold a super tight angle, unfortunately, your teammates end up giving up early engagements and this leaves you in a 2v4 situation, and eventually a 1v3, nice choice to go heaven but because you flew up the ladder you took some early damage and then rushed the utility drop, usually you want to drop the grenade first to do the shock damage and then the molly for the persistence, unfortunately you didn’t peek top hut and this is where an enemy was holding you from. L</li>
                    <li>Scout, no armour, generally whenever you get a rifle I recommend buying armour, trying to hunt the enemy tunnels with your usp while I assume he is on a full buy isn’t a great idea and could have gotten you punished if he was there, fortunately he was not and instead your teammate dealt with him. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, Throwing LOS (Line of sight) utility outside is incredibly dangerous and could have gotten you punished by a peeking enemy fortunately you weren’t peeked at, climbing up to heaven with your back exposed to outside was a little dangerous, I recommend getting comfortable going to places while looking at the most dangerous angle against you, unlucky you went into hell when no-one was covering ramp and ending getting killed by a shotgun who was in an unexpected angle. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice rotation from secret to B site, getting an early kill on the enemy peeking ramp, weird molly on B which was a little bit of a waste and slightly dangerous, coming up vents again onto A in the retake is not ideal as again you as put at a hugely disadvantageous fight there getting killed. L</li>
                    <li>Scout buy, you bought armour this time and utility which is good, playing the same angle as orange and again turning your back to danger while running into CT could have gotten you punished, good attempt at keeping the distance between you and the enemy but whenever presented with a headshot angle you should try to abuse it instead you tried to relocated deeper into CT which got you punished. L</li>
                    <li>T pistol armour, nice pushing into Ramp great usage of jumping to throw off any CT crosshair placement, nice job spotting the enemy single door but you artificially created distance and gave him space you want to force him to come out into the open when he is exposed rather than giving him the fight, unfortunately, you felt pushed into the angle because you were being shot at from an enemy ramp. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10, solid movement and pathing outside although outside is not the ideal angles you really want to be taking while you have such a close-range weapon such as a Mac-10. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10, missed outside close smoke,  good job upgrading to teammates weapon, nice attempt at spamming through the smoke mini, weird off-angle towards outside garage, you didn’t play close enough to your teammates to get a trade on them after they took engagements, really nice display of mechanics flicking and headshot the enemy by vents but the wrong angles were checked, interesting choice to stick the bomb I would have recommended faking it in the 1v1 situation. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting choice to molly behind the ramp smoke maybe causing some damage to an enemy playing close, solid kill on the enemy on site but unfortunately you were immediately traded after you got the kill. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, good job trying to entry into ramp peeks looked solid no enemy spotted, rotation through door instead of hut while teammates are on site, good plant next to teammate covering you, and nice positioning outside hut at an off-angle to get the bodyshot kill on the last enemy. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice movement up to silo and good knowledge of how much of youis exposed, taking a good peek outside, tiny bit of damage on T side especially you do not want any kind of random unnecessary damage as you can accidentally turn the CT M4 into an AK just requiring 1 headshot to kill you if you take too much, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, missed outside smoke again using the wrong lineup, change of position from bottom silo to top, because of lack of confidence in spraying you had full access to an enemy behind blue container but because you chose to tap this allowed him to escape, dropping in front of mini is an inherently dangerous play as the number of angle you are exposed you increases a lot. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, playing top silo good job jiggle peeking the outside angle trying to bait any awpers holding you, you go 1v1 against another rifle behind blue container he taps and so do you unfortunately in this 50/50 fight he wins. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, outside smoke landing weird, running through a smoke into a fight against the secret player fortunately for you he wasn’t holding the smoke properly otherwise he wold have had a huge advantage is this fight, but you manage to flick onto him and get the kill, and then peek ultra wide and get killed by the enemy heaven. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice mouth smoke although by the time you get on site either it missed or it dissipated by then, good job picking up a rifle, no action. W</li>
                    <li>M4 buy, doing the smoke again towards mouth, a little but of unnecessary damage caused you to die to a p250 as he did 93 damage and if you hadn’t taken fall damage he would have had to hit you once more in order to get the kill, small peek and spray whiff on this enemy. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again mouth smoke, kind of a waste as your team had no intention of going A, good ramp take and nice flash although it made your peek very premeditated, good quick trade on the enemy peeking single, solid positioning control but you are not picking a position firmly you are sliding between them and it looks uncomfortable. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again using A utility, molly top hut failed, throwing nade down vent exposed you to an enemy mouth which nearly got you killed also the timing on the nade drop wasn’t a great idea as if he had rushed vent as you dropped your nade you could have been killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice door nade and util onto A, agro play onto A allowing you to get a good trade on your teammate hut and then a follow-up entry onto site, which was great. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, slight waste of utility dropping a flash-off silo only to fall away as no one is peeking of that utility and it doesn’t effect </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try to keep the distance between you and pistols whenever possible I noticed a few times you would accidentally close the distance between you and the upgraded pistols and this would make it easier for them in the fight.</li>
                    <li>Accidentally peeking before your utility lands exposes you to the enemy and thus putting you at a disadvantageous fight.</li>
                    <li>Don’t rotate up vents when retaking A as it severely disadvantages you.</li>
                    <li>Not using the scouts’ speed during peeks instead playing it the exact same way you would play an AWP.</li>
                    <li>Look for patterns in enemies plays like them dropping the same Glave smoke you do and try to counter, humans are creatures of habits and quickly identifying the enemies’ habits will allow you to effectively counter them.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes exposing yourself to multiple positions at once.</li>
                    <li>Tap slightly slower with the usp to make sure all your bullets are completely accurate.</li>
                    <li>Slightly dangerous pathing, always try to choose a path that exposes you as little to the enemies while giving you as much cover as possible.</li>
                    <li>Only pull out your knife when you know you are 100% safe and no one can shoot at you while rotating, this got you punished.</li>
                </ul>

                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <h3>Match 1</h3>
                <p>Map: Nuke</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, nice position outside for the enemy top silo, good tapping on the enemy on site distracted by your teammate heaven landing a solid kill, good quick rotation through secret to B. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice choice to do a full buy second round allowing you the biggest advantage at long-range duels, unfortunately, your first duel the tec-9 landed a headshot on you leaving you very low, and after noticing they were going down secret this distracted you enough that you stopped looking silo and ended up getting killed by a Deagle there. W</li>
                    <li>Scout buy, solid positioning garage with the scout, unfortunately, you decided to crouch on this angle slowing one of the advantages of the scout which is its speed, the enemy peeking outside hit a very nice shot on you from that range. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle armour, and utility interesting choices, nice decision to play glave allowing you to secure a quick kill on the enemy pushing close mini and then going agro to catch a second off-guard, nice clearing of silo by using red container as a headshot angle, small movement mistake getting caught outside fortunately no-one was there to exploit it, nice rotate down secret but it was dangerous to peek so far out after you already knew you were low and had even said you wanted to give him plant, this is what got you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice positioning outside and after realizing you had bomb mini, you had the perfect positioning garage, although you don’t need to worry about secret by peeking hell as you have an off-angle in garage if he goes mini perfect if he comes from secret then good, no need to peek hell of heaven anyways as if he goes through the glass you can’t see him. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice molly outside and good glave smoke, but a little careless on your peek before the smoke landed getting you severely tagged, and instead of trying to reposition inside A or getting a teammate to peek our of mini to help you, you hold for his peekin which he knows your exact position from the earlier engagement, you hit him once for 23, unfortunately they pushed outside very early. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice peek into squeaky, good job picking up a weapon from a dead enemy outside, interesting rotation up vents which is dangerous as you are completely vulnerable as you climb the ladder I would have recommended after the teammate called they were going A, quickly going up secret to backup your teammate mini and have a chance of trading. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, going outside for a pick, small utility mistake with the smoke and small positioning mistake by standing in a position you didn’t know the enemy could already peek you from left side red container. L</li>
                    <li>Scout, solid peeks with the scout allowing you to get a shot off and hide which is the way you should play the scout, but unfortunately on your last peek towards secret you strafed a little wide which allowed you to miss the shot but then for the enemy to react to your position and start shooting you. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good call for the awp for the outside position, nice job playing outside, and good rotation into secret for the quick flank on ramp, slightly dangerous peek into control but you managed to catch the enemy completely off-guard securing a kill. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice job play early but then you threw LOS (line of sight) grenade outside which wasn’t ideal and then you got caught completely off-guard by the enemy peeking left side red container which is the main position you should have been holding. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, small util mistake molly missed outside, nice communication saying they could be down vents, nice spamming hut to do damage inside main on any potential rotates, very quick reposition on B being B silo, good job not going up vents this round, instead rotating up secret, which was good and then a nice peek into Mini killing the enemy heaven, unfortunately your information was off as the enemy had repositioned to left vents which caught you completely off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, interesting choice to hide inside the mini smoke, nearly catching an enemy in mini, very nice shot on the enemy peeking heaven. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, small utility mistake accidentally missing the outside molly, nice spray on the enemy peeking outside to secure an early kill, slight spray whiff on the enemy outside allowing the enemy to swing wide catching you off-guard and causing you to pause mid-way through the engagement to reengage in a spray. L</li>
                    <li>Scout, last round of the half, looking away from the most dangerous position as you tried to rotate into heaven, fortunately the enemy whiffed on you, allowing you to regain your advantage as you hid behind the blow box taking quick scout peeks landing 2 shots, unfortunately after you got his weapon you were extremely low hp and an enemy was in a position you didn’t clear close left mini. L</li>
                    <li>T pistol armour, good positioning behind red container and securing that first kill, unfortunate peek on the second enemy killing you. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice movement up onto outside silo, nice attempt at spamming mini, interesting choice not to immediately switch to the m4 only after you ran around and then killed an enemy mini did you switch, as you rotated outside you were not quiet so only after you got into A main did you walk which basically gave away your position, and the enemy sat left side door as you peeked close catching you off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle armour, good peeks into hut to clear the site, but then you decided to sit in hut and hold the ramp push which isn’t a good idea as you hadn’t cleared site this allowed the enemy to freely peek into hut and get the kill on you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good peek into ramp and nice communication to say what you were seeing unfortunately you were the only one in A main meaning you got flanked by ramp which wasn’t ideal. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice outside smoke and good job trying to use the one-way peeking into garage, but you got killed by an enemy playing glave even after seeing the glave smoke, which is unfortunate and then the player playing glave killed your teammate left side red container. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid movement onto outside silo, teammate was messing it up a bit, nice dink onto the enemy behind blue container, hyper-aggressive play leading to you taking 55 damage from the drop off silo and then being exposed to a few positions which got you killed from secret. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, decided against the close smoke outside, instead smoking garage which was a good decision, unfortunately, purple went hyper-aggressive which didn’t allow you to trade him instantly, and a good kill on the enemy heaven with some clean bursting, but you pulled out your knife to do some movement which meant you were not ready for the last enemy on A site. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice communication about the one that went down vent, solid rotation down to B and good job getting the plant down in the smoke, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, enemies rushed main, and after being left in a 2v1 situation you decide to continue outside which wasn’t a good idea because of you died it would have been a 1v1 and then its a 50/50, good job getting the kill and winning the round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job with the outside smoke and nice rotation down to secret and planting the bomb, haha the enemy tried to instantly defuse which paniced you a bit haha, good kill on the enemy. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice idea for the outside smoke again, nice flick and spray onto the enemy close mini, good job clearing the angles going into tunnels, solid peeks and a molly ramp, good positioning peeking control room and nice off-angle. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice job holding behind although an interesting flash peek, nice molly into mini pushing anyone out of that corner, unfortunately, you got flanked by the ramp player. L</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Match 2</h3>
                <p>Map: Overpass</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, a nice idea to boost a teammate's short and good job jump spotting for any information, slight overrotation as you went up to heaven as they took site from short, tapping slightly too fast causing your bullets to be inaccurate, nice tap and kill on the enemy short in order to secure the win very sketchy start. W</li>
                    <li>MP9, nice middle smoke and good nade into the fountain, dangerous pathing along banana while being exposed to party, a little bit dangerous fall back path out of toilets as your thought you hear one close and instead of holding banana as you fell back to site you didn’t, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice middle smoke, enemy knew your position and landed a perfect nade on you doing 50 damage, possibly identifying your plays early, jump spotting long slightly dangerous, as you were jumping directly up and down making any kill on you easier, overextended towards site ignoring long just before they peeked and this caused you to be caught in a smoke while spraying long. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, after falling off of bathrooms it took you a while to check long potentially leaving you open after a while you did eventually check it, after noting the last position of the enemy you rotated lowers and took your time without giving away your position and then secured the kill on the last enemy peeking short. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, small movement mistake peeking up party into middle, you went back into bathrooms and help party allowing you to secure a kill on the enemy party, peeking banana super aggressive good job being prepared for him but you were too far from cover so after you missed the one shot there was no-where for you to hide. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, nice peek towards fountain but you were slightly aggressive peeking to hold the con peek without having anyone in bathrooms, this looks very uncomfortable, while rotating down you don’t aim onto site although you spot them and drop utility, unfortunate 50/50 fight against the enemy awper pillar. L</li>
                    <li>p250, peek middle died to an enemy spraying fountain. L</li>
                    <li>Scout buy, dangerous positioning banana without having someone holding bathrooms, this led to you holding the peek from the connector and you got unlucky timing as you pull out your knife to fall back you get punished. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, playing bathrooms with an M4, good job falling back to site after your teammate lowers got killed and playing more passive, good information gathering by doing the jump spot, unfortunately after they dropped the long site smoke they peeked the gap it left and you positioned yourself there. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, really nice double dink on the enemy from lowers to party and getting that weapon unfortunately they hunted you with the weapon save. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, solid positioning in bathrooms but unfortunately your timing on the push-through smoke was slightly off and the enemy pushed late.L </li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice positioning in connector slightly weird smoke, nice 180 to get the kill on the enemy middle, unfortunately, you were left by your bathrooms guy this meant the second enemy middle peeked and killed you. L</li>
                    <li>Scout buy, nade damage again, nice positioning to do damage on the enemy balloons, really nice shot on the enemy party although a little dangerous, and small positioning mistake playing map. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice molly middle, slightly dangerous timing on that return nade as they could have peeked again LOS util, nice job picking up your teammates weapon the awp, but getting stuck map again wasn’t ideal as its quite difficult to get out of this position. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, nice change of pace pushing long to get an advanced position and trying to quickly flank, solid kill on the first enemy and nice burst unfortunately you were low hp while going for the ninja. L</li>
                    <li>T-side pistol armour, nice B split, quick bomb plant, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, short taking and good smoke heaven but going slightly over agro when you knew the enemies position and then trying to hide allowed them to prepare themselves for your peek which they won. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice aggression into middle and then pivoting into a solid long take, although and purple being significantly in front of your teammates, could have caused some issues fortunately purple popped off getting a triple. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice middle take and quick movement up long, nice reaction to teammates’ calls getting the late trade in bathrooms. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice bathroom smoke, although lurking through middle could have some nice impact killing enemies trying to flank running banana makes it obvious to the enemies graffiti of your position but you still manage to secure the kill. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy,and went to hold monster but the first one crossed I think you fell asleep a little bit, but good reaction to kill the second one peeking you, although you were going towards B while your teammates were bathroom and long which wasn’t a good idea, this, unfortunately, ended up getting you and your teammate sprayed while peeking B. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid attempt at the short take, but unfortunately you got peeked by lowers while clearing short and this enemy killed you and your teammate pushing short. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice mid take and the smoke bathrooms and good molly banana, to force the awper out and solid kill, unforuantley you were slightly greedy and decided to stick around looking for a CT on A while your team was going towards B this ended up with you getting flanked from bathrooms long. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice calls and good kill on the enemy close long, nice attempt as using the utility to allow you nad your teammates to peek out, unfortunately, the enemy was holding the same gap in the smoke you peeked from long towards Optimus. L</li>
                    <li>Dealge, crazy round, solid attempt at flashing monster and good molly extinguish with your smoke but they dropped a lot of mollies on site and good kill on the enemy headshot. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nearly really unlucky timing with LOS utility smoking the molly monster, nice kill on the enemy peeking monster, trying to peek behind inside monster isn’t a great idea on such low hp giving the enemy the advantage in this fight instead try to position yourself at an off angle near monster. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice movement up long and good killl on the enemy inside bathrooms, solid trade kill on the enemy on site and good attempt at getting the bomb down, unfortunately, your positioning was slightly off the site which allowed the enemy to close the distance. L</li>
                    <li>Dealge, nice awp peek into middle but again being very far from your teammate who has the bomb you end up trying to rejoin with him but an enemy flanked catching you off-guard. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice peeking into middle, accidental whiff on the enemy lowers and closing the distance against the pistol gave him the advantage in this fight and the fact that he was on the headshot angle. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice smoke and molly bathrooms, good job clearing lowers methodically, unfortunate timing on the repeek into middle not expecting there to be an enemy there you got caught off-guard. L</li>

                <p>Map: Vertigo</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, A push up skinny, they counter smoked skinny as you peeked,good job closing the distance between you and the enemy flanking behind allowing your team to not feel as much pressure pushing onto site, unfortunately, you were left in a 1v3 situation, good job faking the rotate, and nice bomb plant but you moved into a position where you couldn’t defend the defuse and unfortunately, this forced you out into the open getting you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice B stairs flash, although the smoke bottom B stairs wasn’t a great idea as it gave the CT’s space and they ended up playing around your smoke and getting the kill on you when you decided to go back towards B. L</li>
                    <li>CZ save, nice positioning bottom B to hold for a push, teammates playing quite agro this ended up leaving you in a 1v4 situation, good job getting one kill, and nice attempt at saving the weapon unfortunately they didn’t let you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice molly skinny to try to flush the enemies out of any comfortable angle, a good attempt at finding a gap in middle, unfortunately, you peeked onto the angle an enemy was holding from CT which caught you off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, nice flash out A ramp and good second flash getting you two flash assists, nice job backing up the teammate getting the kill on the enemy apc, overall solid round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice job pushing through the ramp smoke and not letting it dictate the pace, small mistake pulling out molly when the teammate had already communicated he would be dropping that molly, this, unfortunately, allowed an enemy skinny to get a double kill as you both had utility out. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good communication to call for the middle rush, nice clearing of skinny good angle clearing although you didn’t clear close right as you were coming onto site from skinny, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good patience not pushing anywhere aggressively and just waiting for an opportunity, after seeing your teammate entry onto B good job backing him up and getting the bomb down asap, solid after-plant position holding stairs flank, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at looking over the ramp smoke, good job offering the boost on B site, unfortunate timing on the enemy peeking you this led to you standing in a molly while taking that engagement leading to him only needing to hit one bodyshot. L </li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, aggression into middle unfortunately taking damage from an enemies molly down to 28 hp, and as you are clearing middle the enemy sits at an off angle, all he needed to do was land one shot. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid middle utility and nice attempt at taking middle control, unfortunately, you got double-peeked immediately and this got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice usage of the generator to play a headshot angle, towards the middle, nice movement up B stairs and good job picking up the weapon, unforuantely you decided to continue using the Deagle for the engagement and because you didn’t have head armour the enemy hit an instant headshot. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle armour,  nice clearing of middle good angle clearing and nice crosshair placement, unfortunate timing on the reload scaffolding which led to you being shot in the back from the elevator, fortunately, your teammate immediately traded and won. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unfortunate dink taken from the enemy peeking middle, good job backing up your teammate to get the kill, solid rotation to get the bomb and go B but unfortunately you planted exposed to a peek from APC which your teammate was not immediately covering which got you killed but he managed to get the trade. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, nice push through the smoke to secure the kill on the enemy ramp, although you dropped your molly behind sandbags and were not looking for if an enemy came out instead focusing on getting the weapon and falling back while completely exposed, nice rotate to B and solid after plant for killing a flank although when rotating up you pulled out your deagle for the first engagement which wasn’t a good idea after that you realized it wasn’t the right play and pulled out your AK and secured the first kill and then tried to drop the molly on the bomb instead of just trying to play chicken and this made you mess up your molly and expose yourself. L</li>
                    <li>CT pistol round, solid attempt at positioning yourself sandbags but I think the enemy saw you go there because immediately after you peeked they were holding you. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, again going straight to sandbags, they realized you were there immediately and preaimed you and then when you ran out the smoke they were holding you. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, good job backing up your teammate skinny helping him secure a kill on the enemy, good job taking up the missing position middle and solid reaction to the information. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, nice deep ramp smoke, and skinny molly, although the early rotation put you a bit out of position and the range from back A site is very bad for the famas, good job closing the distance slightly by getting onto site, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, nice play flashing into middle although your positioning was slightly dangerous being exposed to multiple angles at once, good job taking the 1v1’s and getting a solid triple kill. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, good communication about the mid-take and nice job not playing overly aggressively dropping nice flashes, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, nice deep ramp smoke, solid utility into ramp, although falling back to elevator with your teammate was dangerous as someone could have pushed quietly onto Site, good job realizing this and going back to A, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, good utility combo towards A ramp, to help green and yellow take it deep, although your rotation off middle was unfortunately timed as your mid player just died this led to you going back and peeking it but you peeked wide and the enemy was at an angle you didn’t expect giving him the advantage in this fight. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, small smoke fail, using off-angle I recommended which was good and a solid amount of damage, unfortunately, you were left in a 1v4 situation, good job securing the first kill on the enemy CT and good job realizing you should just save in this situation, an enemy caught you at an off-angle. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice quick rotations to B early allowing you to get into a good position unfortunately the enemy dropped a smoke on site and was looking over it by jumping on the box which caught you off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, solid positioning Skinny and nice off-angle good kill on the enemy skinny and good kill on the awper close right. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice kill on the enemy peeking middle, that peek ontop is dangerous as it exposes your body to the enemy before you see them because you are so close to the enemy. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice job holding middle after yellow pushed ramp and nice reactions, unlucky miss on the enemy pushing middle, good job not going for the immediate repeeked, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, Smoke ramp, wasted flash middle as green was just holding it, good reaction to the B utility and nice counter utility,  again peeking top platform nearly got you killed when multiple peeked out ramp and unfortunate miss, and when moving in on the enemy skinny there was an unlucky miss. L</li>
                    <li>Scout buy, leaving ramp wasn’t a good idea after you just gained control of it and you still had people holding midde although you had a nice rotation to A site, solid kill on the enemy retaking. L</li>
